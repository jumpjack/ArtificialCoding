AI-supported reverse engineering of code

# Test 1

Paste in [this page](https://jumpjack.github.io/ArtificialCoding/reverse/c64-code-parser-CHATGPT4%2B4o-003.html) the code from [this page](https://github.com/jumpjack/Attack-of-the-Mutant-Camels-with-AI/blob/master/Original/AMC.asm) to get:
- a table-version of the code
- a [mermaid flowchart](https://github.com/jumpjack/ArtificialCoding/blob/main/reverse/test.mermaid)  of the code (in the console) which you can past [here](https://mermaid.live/) for zoom/edit/analysis (warning: the closed loop of GameLoop routine is not accepted by the editor, only by the viewer).
